# Crafting Interpreters in Python and Rust

This repository holds my work for the book Crafting Interpreters by Robert Nystrom. I have chosen to do the implementation in Python and Rust. Both as an exercise in forcing myself to think about the code instead of simply copying the Java and C code from the book. And to make myself more comfortable with complex topics and how to implement them in the languages I mainly use.

### pLox

A python implementation of Lox. For more info see [pLox README](./plox/README.md)


### rLox

A Rust implementation of Lox. For more info see [rLox README](./rlox/README.md)
